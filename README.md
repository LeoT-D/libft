# libft
Recoding of some basic libc functions. This is not meant to compete with libc. Rather, this was built as a learning tool for my own use.

This library also houses a few of my personal projects.
## ft_prompt
A simple command line prompt complete with basic editing. Usage:

`   char    *ft_prompt(char *prompt_string);`
